     *                 measured against white and clears AA on every accent, where the outline and

     *                 the theme, so the button has to invert with it rather than pin to white.
     *
     * Both re-point the focus ring: the base ring is `--brand` on a `--background` offset, which is
     * an invisible halo on a brand band. The offset goes transparent so the band shows through the
