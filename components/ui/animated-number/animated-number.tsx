/**
 * AnimatedNumber: a figure that rolls when it changes, one character at a time. The value is split
 * into per-character cells; only the characters that actually changed roll (the old glyph lifts up
 * and out, the new rises from below), and they fire in sequence left → right, so "2,450" → "8,125"
 * sweeps across like a departure board instead of the whole block dissolving. Untouched characters
 * never lose a drop of opacity. Driven by the `number-roll-*` keyframes (globals.css, gated on the
 * motion query) with the stagger step coming from `--number-roll-stagger`.
 *
 * Drop it around any changing number: a cart line total, a Stat's value, a live counter.
 * `tabular-nums` keeps the width steady so neighbours never jump, and the whole thing holds still
 * under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
 *
 * Not multi-part in the public sense: it renders one `<span>` of cells it manages itself, so there
 * are no exported parts. Single `tv` recipe, no variants.

    // `tabular-nums` (on the root) is there to stop DIGITS changing width as they roll, but a font
    // applies it to every figure-adjacent glyph, and a comma or a period handed a digit's advance
    // leaves a hole either side of itself: "1,368" sets as "1 , 368". The wider the face, the worse
    // it reads. So the separators, the currency mark and any other non-digit get their natural
    // width back, while the digits keep theirs fixed. Nothing moves: a separator's own width is
    // constant, so only a change in the NUMBER of digits resizes the figure, as it always did.
