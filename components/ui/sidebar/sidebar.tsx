/**
 * Sidebar: the application navigation rail. A multi-part component: one `tv` recipe with
 * `slots`, density flowing to every part through React Context (see docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §2).
 *
 * It is composition, not configuration: you stack the parts in the order you want:
 *
 *   <Sidebar>
 *     <SidebarHeader>                  // workspace switcher lives here
 *       <DropdownMenu>…<SidebarSwitcher title="Koala" subtitle="Enterprise" />…</DropdownMenu>
 *     </SidebarHeader>
 *
 *     <SidebarContent>                 // the scroll region: primary nav, then sections
 *       <SidebarGroup>                 // primary actions/pages, first, unlabeled
 *         <SidebarItem active>…</SidebarItem>
 *       </SidebarGroup>
 *       <SidebarGroup>
 *         <SidebarGroupLabel>Favorites</SidebarGroupLabel>
 *         <SidebarItem>…</SidebarItem>
 *       </SidebarGroup>
 *     </SidebarContent>
 *
 *     <SidebarFooter>                  // profile switcher lives here
 *       <DropdownMenu>…<SidebarSwitcher title="Mara" subtitle="mara@acme.io" />…</DropdownMenu>
 *     </SidebarFooter>
 *   </Sidebar>
 *
 * The two switchers (workspace at the top, profile at the bottom) are the same
 * `SidebarSwitcher` trigger, composed with the DS `DropdownMenu` for the menu behavior:
 * Radix owns the keyboard/focus/ARIA, the Sidebar owns the chrome.
 *
 * Behavior (links vs. buttons) is yours: every `SidebarItem` is a `<button>` by default and
 * `asChild` to wrap an `<a>` / Next `<Link>`. Density resolves once at the root (prop >
 * provider > "compact") and the computed slots flow to every part through context.
