 * radius. `compact` is the Koala default (16px padding/gaps, smaller titles, shorter
 * controls); `comfortable` is the spacious marketing alternative.
 *
 * Unlike `lib/create-context.tsx` (which throws outside its provider), density has a
 * legitimate value with no provider, so the context carries a safe default.

 * Design's `componentSize` and Chakra's theme default work. Precedence: explicit `size` >
 * density-derived default; an explicit `density` arg overrides the provider for that default.
